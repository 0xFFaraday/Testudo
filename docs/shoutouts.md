# Shoutouts

I personally wanted to give a shoutout to the [GOAD](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD) project and its contributors. Another awesome project I recommend checking out is Michael Taggart's [Seclab](https://github.com/mttaggart/seclab).&#x20;

Both of these projects have been amazing resources for getting Testudo in the place it is today!
